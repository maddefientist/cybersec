Apply filters to SQL queries

Project description
My organization is working to make their system more secure. It is my job to ensure the system is safe, investigate all potential security issues, and update employee computers as needed. Here's how I used SQL with filters to perform security-related tasks.

Retrieve after-hours failed login attempts

Scenario: A potential security incident occurred after business hours (after 18:00). All after-hours login attempts that failed need to be investigated.

SQL Query:

SQL
SELECT * 
FROM log_in_attempts 
WHERE login_time > '18:00' 
  AND success = 'FALSE';
Use code with caution.
Sample Output:

username	login_time	success	ip_address
jsmith	2022-03-30 20:12	FALSE	125.212.35.78
baduser12	2022-03-30 19:45	FALSE	201.78.22.103
guest	2022-03-30 18:03	FALSE	192.168.1.150
Retrieve login attempts on specific dates

Scenario: A suspicious event occurred on 2022-05-09. Any login activity that happened on 2022-05-09 or the day before needs to be investigated.

SQL Query:

SQL
SELECT * 
FROM log_in_attempts 
WHERE login_date = '2022-05-09' 
   OR login_date = '2022-05-08';
Use code with caution.
Sample Output:

username	login_time	success	ip_address	login_date
mkang	2022-05-08 16:41	TRUE	192.168.5.23	2022-05-08
jdoe	2022-05-09 08:55	TRUE	10.20.44.12	2022-05-09
jdoe	2022-05-09 09:03	FALSE	10.20.44.12	2022-05-09
Retrieve login attempts outside of Mexico

Scenario:  Abnormal login activity is suspected from locations outside of Mexico.

SQL Query:

SQL
SELECT * 
FROM log_in_attempts 
WHERE country NOT LIKE 'MEX%';
Use code with caution.
Sample Output:

username	login_time	success	ip_address	country
rpatel	2022-03-30 11:15	TRUE	87.120.43.120	India
xyang	2022-03-29 23:50	FALSE	210.96.188.45	China
Retrieve employees in other departments (for targeted updates)

Scenarios: You need to update computers for employees in specific departments (Marketing, Finance, Sales, and those not in IT)

I'll provide one combined example, as the queries are similar:

SQL Query:

SQL
SELECT * 
FROM employees 
WHERE department IN ('Marketing', 'Finance', 'Sales') 
    OR department NOT IN ('IT');  
Use code with caution.
Sample Output:

employee_id	first_name	last_name	department	office
105	Sarah	Johnson	Marketing	East 201
221	Roberto	Gomez	Finance	West 115
45	Emily	Li	Sales	East 305
