My strengths involve adaptability and the ability to react to the given situation. I pride myself in knowing a breadth of tools that allow me to remain flexible and nimble when responding to issues or situations. I am able to take assessment of a situation with careful, calm and meticulous consideration and can then follow with a focused presentation of fact coupled with an objective plan of action that satisfies the organizations top priorities. 

My values are about security, integrity of data and of persons, and doing the right thing. Cybersecurity interests me as it is a crossroads of human experience and response coupled with data systems and technical structures that when used properly can be highly supportive to an organizations goals. Conversely, when not implemented or respected appropriately can become the swift downfall of any organization. 

Overall, my strengths bring a unique perspective from various industries without sacrificing operational expertise. I am seeking to provide value to organizations with a friendly attitude alongside a knowledgeable approach to any task at hand. My goal is to secure assets, data and future trajectories of the company for the success of all stakeholders - without sacrificing values or respect. 



<h3>Completion of the Linux Commmands Course: </h3>
While I have a detailed self driven understanding of the Linux operating system - stemming from my use of linux, configuration of various distribtutions, on SoC's, USBs, computers and laptops, I have completed and in progress of completing several courses related to linux and cyber security as a whole. 

Course Summary: Operating Systems, Linux, & Cybersecurity Foundations

Key Skills & Knowledge Acquired

Operating System Foundations: I have a solid grasp of how operating systems bridge the gap between software, hardware, and users. I understand core OS functions including process management, memory allocation, and user interfaces (both GUI and CLI).
